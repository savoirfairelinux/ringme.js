A template is provided to create your Pull Request. Try to fill the information at the best of your knowledge.

#### Coding Standards

This project uses eslint to enforce coding standards. If you are unfamiliar with the eslint tool, you can find instructions to install and use at
[Getting Stared with ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

##### Note:
It is reccommended to install eslint as a global npm package so that the eslint command may be used on the command line
```
npm install -g eslint //this may require elevated privlidges based on your shell
```

#### Pull request checklist

For your pull request to be merged, the answer to the following questions must be 'yes':

##### General

* Can the branch be merged automatically?
* Can the javascript (.js) files be checked with eslint with no errors?

### Documentation

Documentation is important and can always be improved:

* Installation instructions
* Test procedures
* How to help translating the project

The prefered syntax is Asciidoc. Markdown is also accepted.

### Reporting bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

#### How to submit a good bug report

Please include as many details as possible. An issue template is automatically loaded when you create an issue.
